This is [Ember](https://emberjs.com/) application running only on [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

* It's `TypeScript`'ed by default.
* It uses `vite` to build the app.
* `tailwind` used for styling.

## Description

Main `difference` with classic Ember application is that we don't trying to `automatically` resolve addons and it's dependencies - we just `import` them directly, `only` once needed.

This application does not use `ember-cli` or `embroider` at all.

## Motivation

- ‚ö°Ô∏è No complex build process
- üí° Instant Server Start
- üõ†Ô∏è Rich customization features
- üì¶ Optimized Build
- üî© A lot of supported addons
- üîë TypeScripted by default

## Features

1. Strict mode
1. Lazy-loading for routes
1. Template-only components
1. Style imports from components
1. Ember Inspector
1. Template imports support (`.gts` & `.gjs`)
1. Glint support
1. Testing support (QUnit)
1. Template linting

## Unsupported

1. `ember-data` not supported yet


## Installation

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
# open http://localhost:4200
```

## In scope of this app we able to run this addons

1. `ember-simple-auth`
1. `ember-bootstrap`
1. `ember-concurrency`

*This is not complete list, and you could add `any` ember addon you want (if it don't have `ember-cli` logic)*

## Why?

I would like to bulletproof opinion, that modern ember application could be statically resolvable by default, and I would like to use `Vite` for that. It give as ability to use `TypeScript` and `ESM` by default, and it's very fast.

## Disclaimer

I'm not planning to actively maintain this repo, but if you have any questions, feel free to ask.

In addition, if you looking for options to improve speed of your ember project and you open for contracts - don't shy to contact me.
