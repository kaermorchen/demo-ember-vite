This is Ember application running only on `Vite`, without `ember-cli` and `embroider`.

* It's `TypeScript`'ed by default.
* It uses `vite` to build the app.

## Description

Main difference with classic Ember application, is that we don't trying to automatically resolve addons and it's dependencies - we just import them directly, only once needed.


## Motivation

- ‚ö°Ô∏è Lightning Fast Build process
- üí° Instant Server Start
- üõ†Ô∏è Rich Features
- üì¶ Optimized Build
- üî© A lot of supported addons
- üîë TypeScripted by default

## Features

*This is not complete list, and you could add `any` ember addon you want (if it don't have `ember-cli` logic)*

## Why?

I would like to bulletproof opinion, that modern ember application could be statically resolvable by default, and I would like to use `Vite` for that. It give as ability to use `TypeScript` and `ESM` by default, and it's very fast.

## Disclaimer

I'm not planning to actively maintain this repo, but if you have any questions, feel free to ask.

In addition, if you looking for options to improve speed of your ember project and you open for contracts - don't shy to contact me.
